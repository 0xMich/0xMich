## 👋 Hi !

I build things sometimes useful, sometimes just for fun.

I specialize in building modern, responsive web interfaces with **Vue.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. These are my go-to tools for crafting fast, beautiful, and maintainable frontends.

On the backend, I often use **Laravel**, and I love working with **Linux servers** from setting them up to automating deployments and managing infrastructure.

## 🌱 My Projects

### **Automated Outlook Signature System**  
PowerShell script that generates dynamic HTML email signatures based on Active Directory data, deployed via GPO on Windows Server.

### **VPS Monitoring Dashboard**  
A frontend dashboard built in **Vue.js** + **Tailwind CSS**, using **Axios** to fetch real-time data, for monitoring server stats and health on a personal Linux VPS.
