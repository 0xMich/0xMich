# 👋 Hi !

I'm Michel
I build things — sometimes useful, sometimes just for fun.

I create web apps using **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
I'm also diving into system automation with **PowerShell**, **Linux**, and **server-side scripting**.

Currently learning and experimenting with full-stack development,  
and always up for a good challenge.
